- project: Population-Specific Multiomics Graph Analysis of ACE Protein Expression
  role: Lead ML Engineer
  duration: March 2025
  url: "https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics/Multiomic_graph"
  description: Led the development of a graph-based multiomics pipeline to identify population-specific genetic variants influencing ACE protein expression by integrating protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) data with annotated genomic references. Built scalable, GPU-compatible graph inputs using PyTorch Geometric, facilitating efficient downstream Graph Neural Network analyses. Engineered comprehensive variant-mapping pipelines using pandas and NetworkX to elucidate cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms across populations. Received the “Most Innovative Project” award at the Machine Learning & AI Approaches to Multimodal Problems in Computational Biology Hackathon, highlighting strong collaboration, clear documentation, and impactful innovation.
